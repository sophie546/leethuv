# Equal Sum Grid Partition I

Can you solve this real interview question? Equal Sum Grid Partition I - You are given an m x n matrix grid of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either one horizontal or one vertical cut on the grid such that:

 * Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is non-empty.
 * The sum of the elements in both sections is equal.

Return true if such a partition exists; otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,4],[2,3]]

Output: true

Explanation:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/30/lc.png][https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/30/lc.jpeg]

A horizontal cut between row 0 and row 1 results in two non-empty sections, each with a sum of 5. Thus, the answer is true.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,4]]

Output: false

Explanation:

No horizontal or vertical cut results in two non-empty sections with equal sums. Thus, the answer is false.
